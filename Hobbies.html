<h1>My Favourite Hobbies</h1>
<!--- Sport Hobbies --->

    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p>
        One of my favourite hobby is <strong>football</strong>. I watch football every day, I read about it, from the history of the clubs and leagues to tactics, the rehab of the players and the culture of clubs all around the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Tennis</h2>
    <p>
        In my opinion, the most elegant sport in the world, a place where the perfection is acquired by the coordination and the finesse of the players.
    </p>

    <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <p>
        Basketball offered me multiple role models, from Michael Jordan to Kobe and LeBron, players who gave everything to achieve everything and to be better in every day.

    <p>I know it's a basic hobby, but I like to try new places, to eat new food and to discover places which I never thought I was going to visit them.</p>

    <p>I like to cook and to try every fruit, flavour or a new spice. It's a hobby which I find very relaxing.</p>

    <h2>Fitness</h2>
    <p>Fitness helps me manage stress and improves my mental health. I enjoy challenging myself and seeing my progress over time.</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>I enjoy the continuous learning process - there's always something new to master.I'm self-taught and love exploring new programming languages and frameworks.</p>
